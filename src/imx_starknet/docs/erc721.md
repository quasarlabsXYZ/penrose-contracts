# ERC721

This is an implementation of the ERC721 standard on Starknet. It is inspired by the [OpenZeppelin's Cairo implementation](<[https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts)>) with some modifications to support more use cases.

This design results from a forward-thinking approach to current ERC721 usages beyond the [original specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721). For example, this design formally introduces contract metadata, originally [coined by OpenSea](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata), allowing for an NFT collection to have store-front level metadata. Furthermore, this design deviates from OpenZeppelin's ERC721 standard with the usage of felt arrays to represent Token URIs in Cairo. This issue arises due to the lack of strings in Cairo and is [addressed by OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/main/docs/ERC721.md#interpreting-erc721-uris), however, we find that the vast majority of NFT projects require Token URIs with more than 31 characters and as such, present an alternative approach to OpenZeppelin. The effects of this change are minimal and are discussed in the compatibility section.

We also present a recommended preset `ERC721_Full`, which implements key functionality such as Access Control, Bridgeable, [Royalty](./erc2981.md), Token Metadata, and Contract Metadata. This functionality is sufficient for the majority of ERC721 use cases but is also [extensible to new functionality](https://community.starknet.io/t/contract-extensibility-pattern/210) should it be required.

- `IERC721.cairo`: Interface exposing the standard ERC721 functionality

- `ERC721_Full.cairo`: The recommended ready to deploy ERC721 contract. It implements the standard ERC721 functionality, along with the functionality for Access Control, Bridgable, Royalty, Token Metadata and Contract Metadata. Most NFT use cases can use this as an off the shelf solution

- `token/erc721/library.cairo`: Implementation of the base ERC721 primitives, mostly derived from OpenZeppelin's ERC721 library. The exception is that methods related to the `tokenURI` have been moved to `token/erc721_token_metadata/library.cairo`

- `IERC721_Contract_Metadata.cairo`: Interface exposing only the Contract Metadata functionality

- `token/erc721_contract_metadata/library.cairo`: Implementation of the contract metadata functionality

- `IERC721_Token_Metadata.cairo`: Interface exposing only the Token Metadata functionality

- `token/erc721_token_metadata/library.cairo`: Implementation of the token metadata functionality

## Contract Interfaces

```python
@contract_interface
namespace IERC721:
    func balanceOf(owner : felt) -> (balance : Uint256):
    end

    func ownerOf(tokenId : Uint256) -> (owner : felt):
    end

    func safeTransferFrom(
            from_ : felt, to : felt, tokenId : Uint256, data_len : felt, data : felt*):
    end

    func transferFrom(from_ : felt, to : felt, tokenId : Uint256):
    end

    func approve(approved : felt, tokenId : Uint256):
    end

    func setApprovalForAll(operator : felt, approved : felt):
    end

    func getApproved(tokenId : Uint256) -> (approved : felt):
    end

    func isApprovedForAll(owner : felt, operator : felt) -> (isApproved : felt):
    end
end

@contract_interface
namespace IERC721_Contract_Metadata:
    func contractURI() -> (contract_uri_len : felt, contract_uri : felt*):
    end

    func setContractURI(contract_uri_len : felt, contract_uri : felt*):
    end
end

@contract_interface
namespace IERC721_Token_Metadata:
    func tokenURI(tokenId : Uint256) -> (tokenURI_len : felt, tokenURI : felt*):
    end

    func setBaseURI(base_token_uri_len : felt, base_token_uri : felt*):
    end

    func setTokenURI(tokenId : Uint256, tokenURI_len : felt, tokenURI : felt*):
    end

    func resetTokenURI(tokenId : Uint256):
    end
end
```

## ERC721 Compatibility

The Immutable X ERC721 implementation follows the [same compatibility approach as OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/main/docs/ERC721.md#erc721-compatibility) with a key exception. We choose to use `(tokenURI_len : felt, tokenURI : felt*)` instead of `felt` to represent a TokenURI, i.e. a felt array instead of a felt. This approach is taken as a very common Token URI pattern for NFTs is using IPFS, for example, `ipfs://bafybeic3ui4dj5dzsvqeiqbxjgg3fjmfmiinb3iyd2trixj2voe4jtefgq/metadata.json` which exceeds the 31 character limitation of a felt.

As we introduce this representation, we must also present a way to convert to this format. A popular function used to convert strings to felt arrays is by [Sekai Studio](https://github.com/sekai-studio/starknet-libs/blob/main/utils/cairo_string.utils.ts). However, this implementation is not optimal as a felt is used for each character. An optimal solution would pack 31 characters into each felt. We introduce this optimal encoding mechanism as a simple utility function that can be used in your projects:

```ts
/**
 * Splits a string into an array of short strings (felts). A Cairo short string (felt) represents up to 31 UTF-8 characters.
 * @param {string} str - The string to convert
 * @returns {bigint[]} - The string converted as an array of short strings as felts
 */
export function strToFeltArr(str: string): BigInt[] {
  const size = Math.ceil(str.length / 31);
  const arr = Array(size);

  let offset = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    const substr = str.substring(offset, offset + 31).split("");
    const ss = substr.reduce(
      (memo, c) => memo + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16),
      ""
    );
    arr[i] = BigInt("0x" + ss);
    offset += 31;
  }

  return arr;
}
```

We also present the inverse:

```ts
/**
 * Converts an array of utf-8 numerical short strings into a readable string
 * @param {bigint[]} felts - The array of encoded short strings
 * @returns {string} - The readable string
 */
export function feltArrToStr(felts: bigint[]): string {
  return felts.reduce(
    (memo, felt) => memo + Buffer.from(felt.toString(16), "hex").toString(),
    ""
  );
}
```

This encoding and decoding function can be used by marketplaces to obtain the Token URI for an ERC721. This encoding and decoding mechanism can be used in all situations which demand string representations in Cairo. As Token URIs do not demand on-chain string manipulation, we do not currently provide a Cairo library to manipulate on-chain felt arrays encoded using our functions. We welcome community suggestions and implementations for this!

Besides the Token URI, all else remains backward compatible with OpenZeppelin's implementation. The Token URI is almost never used for smart contracts that interact with ERC721s. This means that a project using the Immutable X implementation instead of OpenZeppelin would have the same on-chain experience as that of a project using OpenZeppelin's implementation. e.g. An ERC721 Staking contract that supports OpenZeppelin's ERC721 would also support Immutable's ERC721.

## Presets

### ERC721_Full

An ERC721 implementation with the extensions:

- Access Control
- Bridgeable
- Royalty
- Token Metadata
- Contract Metadata

Our recommended preset ERC721_Full includes the implementation required for the majority of NFT projects. The interface definition for ERC721_Full includes all the functionality. Here we cover the use cases for this preset.

Any NFT project using ERC721 contracts will require the functionality as defined by the [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), all of which is included in a Cairo-friendly way, allowing for transfers and more.

NFT projects will often want to 'mint' tokens. This preset includes the `permissionedMint` function, which allows an address with the minter role to mint an NFT. The contract owner has the power to delegate roles.

This preset also includes `permissionedBurn`, which allows an address with the burner role to burn an NFT.

The contract owner can also choose to set a mutable collection wide Base URI, functionality similar to that [often seen in Solidity](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-baseURI--). They can choose to override the Token URI for particular Token IDs which takes precedence over the Base URI. The overriding Token URI can also be removed to return to usage of the Base URI for particular Token IDs.

The contract owner can also set a mutable collection-wide Contract URI, which can be used by marketplaces to present a 'store-front'.

The contract owner can also set royalties, enforceable by marketplaces. The approach implemented is the 'unidirectional' implementation, further discussed in our [ERC2981 document](./erc2981.md)

## Extensions

One of our extensions to the OpenZeppelin implementation pertain to the usage of Metadata. For both the Token Metadata and Contract Metadata, we use felt arrays such that an arbitrary string could be appropriately encoded. An example of the deployment of an ERC721, following by the setting and getting of Token and Contract Metadata is demonstrated

### Usage

```ts
import { starknet } from "hardhat";
import { StarknetContractFactory } from "hardhat/types";
import { feltArrToStr, strToFeltArr, toUint256WithFelts } from "./utils/utils";

async function main() {
  // owner deploys their wallet (note: this wallet is ephemeral and should be saved)
  const ownerAccount = await starknet.deployAccount("OpenZeppelin");

  const contractFactory: StarknetContractFactory =
    await starknet.getContractFactory("ERC721_Full");

  // owner deploys the ERC721 contract
  const contract = await contractFactory.deploy({
    name: starknet.shortStringToBigInt("Rez's Raging Rhinos"),
    symbol: starknet.shortStringToBigInt("REZ"),
    owner: BigInt(ownerAccount.starknetContract.address),
  });

  // owner grants themselves a minter role
  await acc1.invoke(contract, "grantRole", {
    role: starknet.shortStringToBigInt("MINTER_ROLE"),
    account: BigInt(ownerAccount.starknetContract.address),
  });

  // owner mints a token to themself
  await ownerAccount.invoke(contract, "mint", {
    to: BigInt(ownerAccount.starknetContract.address),
    tokenId: toUint256WithFelts("0"),
  });

  // owner sets the base URI
  const baseUrl =
    "ipfs://this-is-a-reasonable-sized-base-uri-set-by-the-owner/";
  const baseTokenURI = strToFeltArr(baseUrl);
  await ownerAccount.invoke(contract, "setBaseURI", {
    base_token_uri: baseTokenURI,
  });
  // owner gets the token Id for the minted token
  const tokenId = toUint256WithFelts("0");
  const resultURIArr = (await contract.call("tokenURI", { tokenId })).tokenURI;
  const resultURI = feltArrToStr(resultURIArr);
  // This logs 'ipfs://this-is-a-reasonable-sized-base-uri-set-by-the-owner/0'
  console.log(resultURI);

  // owner can set a contract URI
  const contractURI = strToFeltArr(
    "ipfs://the-owner-is-trying-set-a-reasonable-sized-contract-uri/"
  );
  await ownerAccount.invoke(contract, "setContractURI", {
    contract_uri: contractURI,
  });

  const resultContractURIArr = (await contract.call("contractURI"))
    .contract_uri;
  const resultContractURI = feltArrToStr(resultContractURIArr);
  // This logs 'ipfs://the-owner-is-trying-set-a-reasonable-sized-contract-uri/'
  console.log(resultContractURI);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

The imported utilities can be found in our repository. One can execute this script by following our repository README, then adding this script in the `test` directory with the name `myscript.ts`, following by executing `npx hardhat run test/myscript.ts` while a local devnet instance is running.
